A Vision Document is a very high level design document. You don't go into and specifics. Its the document that you usually make your pitch with. You highlight the overall concept of the game, any cool features it will have and how the players will generally feel and interact with the game. Consider this a broad outline of the GDD.

A Technical Design Document is exactly what it sounds like. It covers the technical aspects of development. That will be things like how the networking is done, asset formats, where files are stored and how things are saved, etc. This will often also contain things like the screen flowchart and detail how and when menus are accessed.

The Game Design Document is the detailed bible that exists (and changes) throughout the development. It describes all of the aspects of gameplay, explains each level, character dialogue, etc. It will detail every item that the player can have in their inventory, when each weapon does, etc, etc, etc. This will typically contain everything except specific math (leave that up to the programmer to decide) and the specific technical stuff (such as how things will be saved, peer 2 peer vs. dedicated server, etc. Pu that in the TDD).
